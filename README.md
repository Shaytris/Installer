# The Installer

*The Shaytris installer*

Shaytris for the longest time has needed some way to install it without much issue.

This repo is for the multiplatform* (Not supported on Windows yet) shaytris installer

# Stuff to do

Add windows support (most likely down with a powershell script)

Make a GUI frontend

Hide the terminal/powershell etc window when installing (The GUI needs to be done first)
